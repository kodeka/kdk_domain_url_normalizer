# KDK Domain URL Normalizer (v1.1.0)

A simple plugin to rewrite multiple domains or subdomains to a single domain in the site's HTML output.

The plugin can also normalize the domain protocol (http:// to https:// and vice versa) as well as additional ports (e.g. example.com:8080 to www.example.com and vice versa).

Some practical uses:

- Normalize the domain after migrating WordPress from a test domain to the production one.
- Allow the WordPress admin to be served from a different subdomain (e.g. when WordPress is served over a CDN and you want to avoid any caching of static data etc.). This would require passing on multiple domains/subdomains in your wp-config.php file like so:
```
// Map multiple domains in WordPress
$primary_domain = 'www.domain.tld';
$secondary_domains = array(
    'www2.domain.tld',
    'admin.domain.tld',
    'whatever.domain.tld'
);

if(in_array($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], $secondary_domains)){
    define('WP_HOME', 'https://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);
    define('WP_SITEURL', 'https://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']);
} else {
    define('WP_HOME', 'https://'.$primary_domain);
    define('WP_SITEURL', 'https://'.$primary_domain);
}

// Share cookies across subdomains
define('COOKIE_DOMAIN', '.domain.tld');
```
- When you want to switch your site from HTTP to HTTPS and you want all internal resources to be properly linked through HTTPS as well.
